# Phoenix Notes

## Description

I needed a quick easy way to store notes, and the added benefit of being able to practice at the same time helps retain the information. I built this to get a better grasp at what kind of world I am stepping into, also better understand how coding functions. This provides me a great place to reference back to at anytime and update as I go, with being a great test bed for my future knowledge.
From what I have learned so far Im only in a droplet to what I can and will learn.

## Installation

## Usage

It will house any and all notes that I require throughout this boot camp and possibly my career. With each section having quick access notes in a organized fashion I can find what im looking for. Opening up the DevTools console we can see the JavaScript running. It lists the topics I learned from the prework and randomly selects a topc for me to study. Being able to update it as I go makes it easy to keep track of everything and go back to brush up on anything I might have trouble with.
